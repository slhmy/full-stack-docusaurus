# 🐸 Full Stack Docusaurus

Recording all my learning process of full stack development.

I currently use Notion for faster recording and publish a site in zh-CN there 👉 [slhmy's Technical Notes](https://slhmy-creative.notion.site/slhmy-creative/7225b9f7b59c418d92fc234a93fc2753?v=228a42c06c5a44778a39d10850becf4a). But all these stuff will finally go into here in this repo.

## 📝 Editing

Some common usage in daily editing.

### Dev with Specific Locale

```bash
npm run start -- --locale zh-CN
```

### Translate

```bash
npx docusaurus write-translations -l zh-CN
```

### Draft

**There is a gitignored `draft` named folder** in the root of this project,
put everything you want to draft in it.

#### Converting HTML Content to Markdown

This script will create a `.raw.md` file in the same directory of the html file.

```bash
# Make sure you have installed dependencies
node scripts/html2md.ts <path-to-html>
```
